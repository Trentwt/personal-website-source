I&#39;m graduating from the University of Toronto with a major in computer science and minors in environmental studies and statistics. I&#39;m passionate about software development, data science, and environmental sustainability. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow. I&#39;m seeking a full-time position in software development or data science. I would be honoured to have the chance to work with you.</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">I have been programming since I was around ten years old. My first programming language was Java, which I used to develop Minecraft mods as a very light hobby. Around the same time, I learned to make games using LWJGL, a Java game development library and later moved on to learning Unity. However, I also immediately became fascinated with web development. My first website was made using pure HTML and CSS using Adobe Dreamweaver, a now-defunct software initially used for creating, viewing, and testing sites in real time.</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">In high school, I began to learn the basics of JavaScript while also getting back to game development. With a pixel artist, I helped design a detailed two-dimensional story-based game built using Processing, a Java-based graphics library. That was my passion project at the time. I was elected the lead programmer of North Toronto Collegiate Institute&#39;s VEX robotics team in 2018. I performed excellently in developing and testing an autonomous system for our robot.</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">A couple of years later, I was accepted into the computer science program at the University of Toronto&#39;s St. George campus. At this time, I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life, but my calling was always something related to computers. I found joy in simply helping people fix computer-related problems and have been the go-to person for tech support among my family and close friends.</p> <h5>Academics and experience</h5> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">Since being accepted into the computer science program, I have developed a foundation in data structures and algorithms and broadened my horizons by learning and improving my skills in various programming languages. I used C/C++, Java, Racket, Haskell, JavaScript/TypeScript, and Python in school. Part of my experience from school has been in writing code to train and test machine learning models. Most of the code I have written about machine learning uses PyTorch. I eventually finished my statistics minor; since then, I have taken courses from the School of the Environment, learning how to use data to model issues in environmental studies, which would later become my second minor.</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">Since then, I have strengthened my ability to read and write code in Python and R and learned to use libraries like NumPy and Matplotlib, as well as complete frameworks such as Tableau, to analyze and visualize data. I have also learned to use libraries like scikit-learn to train and test machine learning models.</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">I have experience in the Information Technology field, stemming from my time as a web developer intern at Canadian law firm Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt, and my passion has continued to be web and full-stack development. I was the team lead in developing a banking tie-in microservice, when my team signed up to help with the new CheaprEats Centro student finance management app. For that project, I used TypeScript and the JSON RPC protocol, as well as MongoDB. I am open to using other frameworks and languages as well, and I consider myself qualified for positions in a large variety of roles, not just those in web development and infrastructure.</p> <h5>And by the way...</h5> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">If you made it this far, thank you so much for reading my little blurb about myself! I am a passionate and driven programmer with room to improve in all areas, and I would love the opportunity to interview for your company.</p> <br> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">Best regards,</p> <p class="svelte-tjc1gx">Trent W. Thompson</p></div></div></main></main> <footer class="w-full mt-5 p-8 bg-gray-200" data-svelte-h="svelte-6hjfbu"><p>Â© 2024 Trent W.
